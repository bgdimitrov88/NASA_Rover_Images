# NASA Rover Images

I have created this project as an example of WinForms used with the Supervising Controller flavour of the [MVP pattern](http://webclientguidance.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ModelViewPresenterPatternDescription). 

The application uses the [NASA Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos) to get image date for a specific rover on a specific day.

In order to the run the app you must apply for a free [NASA API Key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key) and insert it in _uriFormat variable in <code>NasaApiCommunicator.cs</code>
